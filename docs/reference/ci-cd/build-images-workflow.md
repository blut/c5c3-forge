# Build Images Workflow

Reference documentation for the GitHub Actions build-images workflow and the verify-container-images workflow. The build-images workflow builds, tags, and publishes container images for
OpenStack services to GHCR (GitHub Container Registry). Each pushed image receives OCI
Image Spec annotations, a CycloneDX SBOM, a Sigstore-signed attestation, and a Grype vulnerability scan with SARIF upload to the GitHub Security tab. The verify-container-images workflow runs static verification tests against
container infrastructure files (Dockerfiles, workflows, release configs) without requiring
Docker.

Repeated inline step sequences are extracted into reusable composite GitHub Actions
(`.github/actions/setup-docker-registry/`, `.github/actions/supply-chain-attest/`,
`.github/actions/checkout-service-source/`, `.github/actions/export-digest/`) and
standalone CI scripts (`hack/ci-merge-manifest.sh`, `hack/ci-run-unit-tests.sh`), reducing
duplication across jobs. All jobs produce identical outputs and maintain the same
security pipeline. See [Reusable Components](#reusable-components) for details.

## File Locations

| File | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Build Images workflow | `.github/workflows/build-images.yaml` |
| Verify Container Images workflow | `.github/workflows/verify-container-images.yaml` |
| Setup Docker Registry action | `.github/actions/setup-docker-registry/action.yaml` |
| Supply Chain Attest action | `.github/actions/supply-chain-attest/action.yaml` |
| Checkout Service Source action | `.github/actions/checkout-service-source/action.yaml` |
| Export Digest action | `.github/actions/export-digest/action.yaml` |
| Merge Manifest script | `hack/ci-merge-manifest.sh` |
| Run Unit Tests script | `hack/ci-run-unit-tests.sh` |

Both workflow files use the `.yaml` extension and quote the trigger key as `"on"` to
prevent YAML boolean interpretation. They start with the standard SPDX license
header (matching `ci.yaml`).

## Trigger Events

The workflow triggers on two events:

| Event | Scope | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `push` | `branches: [main, stable/**]` | Runs on every push to `main` or any `stable/**` branch (recursive glob) |
| `pull_request` | all branches | Runs on every pull request |

Push events produce multi-arch images pushed to GHCR. Pull request events produce
single-arch images loaded locally for testing (see [PR vs Push Behavior](#pr-vs-push-behavior)).

> **Fork PRs are not supported.** Base images must be pushed to GHCR on every run
> (because downstream `docker-image://` URIs require registry availability), but fork
> PRs receive a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` that cannot write packages. The workflow
> detects fork PRs and fails fast with a clear error message.

## Permissions

Top-level permissions grant least privilege. Registry write access and
attestation permissions are scoped to merge and build jobs only:

```yaml
# Top-level (applies to all jobs)
permissions:
  contents: read

# Job-level (merge jobs + build-service-images)
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write
  id-token: write
  attestations: write
  security-events: write

# Verification jobs (verify-base-images, verify-service-images)
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: read
```

`contents: read` allows repository checkout. `packages: write` is granted to
`build-base-images`, `build-service-images`, `build-tempest` (for pushing per-platform
digests) and to `merge-base-images`, `merge-tempest-image`, `merge-service-images` (for
pushing manifest lists).
`id-token: write` enables Sigstore keyless OIDC signing: the GitHub Actions runner
requests a short-lived OIDC token bound to the workflow identity, which Sigstore uses to
sign the attestation without managing keys. `attestations: write` grants
access to the GitHub Attestations API for storing signed attestations.
`security-events: write` allows uploading Grype vulnerability scan results in SARIF
format to the GitHub Security tab. These three permissions are scoped to the
merge jobs (`merge-base-images`, `merge-tempest-image`, `merge-service-images`) and to
`build-service-images` and `build-tempest` (for PR-only Grype scans via
`supply-chain-attest` with `scan-mode: image`). The verification jobs
(`verify-base-images`, `verify-service-images`) do **not** receive `id-token`,
`attestations`, or `security-events` permissions: they only need `contents: read` (for
checkout and test scripts) and `packages: read` (for pulling images from GHCR), following
the principle of least privilege.

## Concurrency

The workflow uses a concurrency group scoped per-branch per-workflow:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.workflow }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
```

For pull requests, pushing new commits cancels any in-progress build for that same PR
branch. For pushes to `main` or `stable/**`, in-progress runs are **not** cancelled,
ensuring every merge commit produces a complete set of images.

## Reusable Components

Repeated inline step sequences are extracted into six composite GitHub Actions and
four standalone CI scripts. These components encapsulate patterns that were previously
duplicated across multiple jobs, ensuring consistency and reducing the workflow from
~934 lines to under 600 lines. All components follow the repository's CI script
and composite action conventions.

### setup-docker-registry

Configures Docker Buildx, authenticates to a container registry, and optionally installs
cosign for image signing. Replaces the three-step setup sequence (buildx + login + cosign)
that was previously inlined in every job.

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `registry` | no | `ghcr.io` | Container registry URL |
| `username` | yes | — | Registry username |
| `password` | yes | — | Registry password/token |
| `install-cosign` | no | `'true'` | Whether to install cosign |

**Usage:** All 9 jobs that previously inlined docker login + buildx + cosign now call
this composite action. Jobs that do not need cosign (build jobs, verification jobs) pass
`install-cosign: 'false'`. Only merge jobs (which run attestation and signing) leave it
at the default `'true'`.

### supply-chain-attest

Runs the full supply chain security pipeline for a container image: CycloneDX SBOM
generation, Grype vulnerability scanning, SARIF upload to the GitHub Security tab, SBOM
attestation, build provenance attestation, and cosign signing. Replaces the ~65-line
inline sequence that was previously duplicated for each image type.

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image-name` | yes | — | Bare image name without tag/digest (e.g. `ghcr.io/c5c3/python-base`) |
| `image-digest` | yes | — | Image digest (`sha256:...`) |
| `sbom-output-file` | yes | — | SBOM output filename (e.g. `sbom-python-base.cyclonedx.json`) |
| `grype-category` | yes | — | SARIF category for the GitHub Security tab |
| `scan-mode` | no | `'sbom'` | `'sbom'` for full supply chain (non-PR) or `'image'` for scan-only (PR) |
| `image-ref-for-scan` | no | `''` | Full image ref for image-mode scan |

**Scan modes:**

- **`sbom` mode** (push events): Generates SBOM, scans via SBOM, uploads SARIF, creates
  SBOM attestation, creates build provenance attestation, and signs with cosign. This is
  the full supply chain pipeline.
- **`image` mode** (PR events): Scans the image directly with Grype and uploads SARIF.
  No SBOM generation, no attestation, no signing. Provides vulnerability feedback on PRs
  without the overhead of full attestation.

**Usage:** `python-base`, `venv-builder`, `tempest`, and service images all call this
composite action. Merge jobs use `sbom` mode; build jobs use `image` mode for PR-only
scans. This replaces the per-image-type inline SBOM + Grype + SARIF + attest + provenance
+ cosign sequences.

### checkout-service-source

Resolves the upstream source ref for an OpenStack service from `source-refs.yaml`, checks
out the upstream repository, applies release-specific patches, and runs constraint
overrides. Replaces the multi-step source preparation sequence that was previously
duplicated (with "MUST stay in sync" comments) between `build-service-images` and
`test-service-images`.

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `service` | yes | — | OpenStack service name (e.g. `keystone`) |
| `release` | yes | — | Release directory name (e.g. `2025.2`) |

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source-ref` | Resolved version string from `source-refs.yaml` |

**Internal steps:**

1. Installs `yq` (SHA-pinned `mikefarah/yq`)
2. Reads the version from `releases/<release>/source-refs.yaml` via `yq` (fails with
   `::error::` if not found or null)
3. Checks out `openstack/<service>` at the resolved ref into `src/<service>`
4. Applies patches from `patches/<service>/<release>/*.patch` via `git apply` (skipped if
   no patches exist, guarded by `hashFiles`)
5. Runs `scripts/apply-constraint-overrides.sh <release>`

**Usage:** Both `build-service-images` and `test-service-images` call this composite
action, eliminating the source checkout duplication and the three "MUST stay in sync"
comments.

### export-digest

Writes an image digest to a staging directory and uploads it as a GitHub Actions artifact.
Replaces the inline `mkdir` + `touch` + `upload-artifact` pattern that was previously
duplicated for each image type.

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `digest` | yes | — | Image digest (`sha256:...`) |
| `artifact-name` | yes | — | Name for the uploaded artifact |
| `digest-dir` | no | `/tmp/digests` | Directory for digest files |

**Usage:** `python-base`, `venv-builder`, `tempest`, and service images all call this
composite action after building, replacing inline `mkdir`/`touch`/`upload-artifact` steps.

### hack/ci-merge-manifest.sh

Merges per-platform digest files into a multi-arch manifest using
`docker buildx imagetools create`, then inspects the result to extract and output the
final manifest digest. Follows the repo's CI-script conventions: shebang, SPDX header,
`set -euo pipefail`, env var interface with `::error::` annotations.

| Env var | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `IMAGE` | yes | — | Full image name without tag (e.g. `ghcr.io/c5c3/python-base`) |
| `DIGEST_DIR` | yes | — | Path to directory containing digest files |
| `TAGS` | yes | — | Space-separated list of full tag references to apply |
| `INSPECT_TAG` | no | first entry in `TAGS` | Tag for post-creation digest inspection |

Writes `digest=sha256:<hex>` to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`.

**Usage:** `merge-base-images` (×2 for python-base and venv-builder),
`merge-tempest-image`, and `merge-service-images` all call this script via `run:` with
env vars passed through the step's `env:` block.

### hack/ci-run-unit-tests.sh

Runs stestr-based OpenStack service unit tests inside a `venv-builder` container image.
Handles volume mounts for source code, constraints, test excludes, and result collection.
Follows the repo's CI-script conventions.

| Env var | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SERVICE_NAME` | yes | — | OpenStack service name (e.g. `keystone`) |
| `SERVICE_VERSION` | yes | — | Version string for PBR PKG-INFO |
| `INSTALL_SPEC` | yes | — | pip install spec (e.g. `.[ldap]` or `.`) |
| `VENV_BUILDER_IMAGE` | yes | — | Docker image to run tests in |
| `RELEASE` | yes | — | Release directory name (e.g. `2025.2`) |
| `WORKSPACE_DIR` | no | `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` or `pwd` | Root workspace directory |
| `OS_TEST_DBAPI_ADMIN_CONNECTION` | no | — | oslo.db admin connection string for opportunistic DB tests |

Writes `results/testresults.subunit` to the workspace.

**Usage:** `test-service-images` calls this script, replacing the ~50-line inline
`docker run` block. The script can also be run locally with appropriate env vars for
debugging failed tests.

## Jobs

The workflow defines thirteen jobs with a dependency graph:

```text
lint-dockerfiles ─┬──> build-keystone-federation-proxy (matrix: amd64 + arm64)
prepare ──────────┤      └──> merge-keystone-federation-proxy-image (push only)
                  │
                  └──> build-base-images (matrix: amd64 + arm64)
                         └──> merge-base-images ──> verify-base-images ──┬──> generate-matrix
                                                                         │
                         ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                         ├──> build-tempest (matrix: release × platform)
                         │       └──> merge-tempest-image (push only)
                         │
                         ├──> build-service-images (matrix: service × release × platform)
                         │       └──> merge-service-images ──┐
                         │                                   ├──> verify-service-images (push only)
                         └──> test-service-images ───────────┘
                                    └── hack/ci-run-unit-tests.sh (stestr run)
```

Each platform (linux/amd64 on `ubuntu-latest`, linux/arm64 on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`) is
built on a native runner and pushed by digest. `merge-base-images` then assembles the
multi-arch manifest list and runs the supply chain security pipeline via the
`supply-chain-attest` composite action. The same pattern applies to service
images via `build-service-images` and `merge-service-images`, and to Tempest images via
`build-tempest` and `merge-tempest-image`.

The `verify-base-images` job validates base image properties (Python version, user
UID/GID, PATH, uv version) before service image builds begin. This catches base image
regressions before they cascade into service image failures. The `test-service-images`
job runs upstream unit tests for each service via `hack/ci-run-unit-tests.sh`, in parallel with `build-service-images`. On push events, the
`verify-service-images` job validates service images pulled from GHCR and gates on
`merge-service-images` and `test-service-images`. On PRs, the equivalent image
verification runs as an inline step within `build-service-images` because `--load` makes
the image available only on the same runner (ARM64 is excluded on PRs).

All jobs use the `setup-docker-registry` composite action for Docker Buildx
setup, registry authentication, and optional cosign installation, replacing the
previously duplicated three-step setup sequence.

### build-keystone-federation-proxy / merge-keystone-federation-proxy-image

The Apache federation reverse-proxy sidecar for Keystone: `mod_auth_openidc`
(OIDC) and `mod_auth_mellon` (SAML) in one image
(`images/keystone-federation-proxy/`, single-stage `ubuntu:noble` + distro
`apache2` + `libapache2-mod-auth-openidc` + `libapache2-mod-auth-mellon`). The
image is release-independent (no OpenStack code), so the job pair follows
the base-image shape rather than the release matrix: a two-platform build
job that depends only on `lint-dockerfiles` and `prepare` (PR mode loads
the amd64 image locally for the inline Grype scan and the
`tests/container-images/verify_keystone_federation_proxy.sh` verify
script), and a PR-skipped merge job assembling the multi-arch manifest with
the `:latest` + `:<sha>` tag scheme the base images use, followed by the
supply-chain pipeline (SBOM, attestation, cosign).

### build-base-images

Builds the two base images (`python-base` and `venv-builder`) per platform on native
runners and pushes each single-arch image by digest. These must always be
pushed (even on PRs) because downstream service builds reference them via
`docker-image://` URIs, which require registry availability. The multi-arch manifest list
is assembled by the subsequent `merge-base-images` job.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `runs-on` | <code v-pre>${{ matrix.runner }}</code> (`ubuntu-latest` for amd64, `ubuntu-24.04-arm` for arm64) |
| `timeout-minutes` | `30` |
| `needs` | `[lint-dockerfiles]` |
| Matrix | `platform: [linux/amd64, linux/arm64]` × native runner |
| Push behavior | Pushes by digest to GHCR (even on PRs); tags assigned by `merge-base-images` |

**Steps:**

::: v-pre

| # | Step | Action / Command | Details |

### merge-base-images

Downloads per-platform digests from `build-base-images`, assembles multi-arch manifest
lists, then runs SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, attestation, and cosign signing
on the final manifests.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `runs-on` | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `timeout-minutes` | `15` |
| `needs` | `[build-base-images]` |
| Permissions | `contents: read`, `packages: write`, `id-token: write`, `attestations: write`, `security-events: write` |

**Steps:**

::: v-pre

| # | Step | Action / Command | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Checkout | `actions/checkout@v7` | Checks out the repository |
| 2 | Normalize image owner | Shell script | Outputs lowercase `owner` value |
| 3 | Setup Docker registry | `.github/actions/setup-docker-registry` | Buildx + GHCR login + cosign |
| 4 | Download python-base digests | `actions/download-artifact@v4` | Downloads all `digests-python-base-*` artifacts, merges into `/tmp/digests/python-base/` |
| 5 | Create python-base manifest | `hack/ci-merge-manifest.sh` | Assembles per-platform digests into multi-arch manifest; tags `:latest` and `:${{ github.sha }}`; outputs merged manifest digest |
| 6 | Supply chain attest python-base | `.github/actions/supply-chain-attest` | SBOM + Grype scan + SARIF upload + attestation + provenance + cosign sign. Uses `scan-mode: sbom` on push, `image` on PR |
| 7 | Download venv-builder digests | `actions/download-artifact@v4` | Downloads all `digests-venv-builder-*` artifacts |
| 8 | Create venv-builder manifest | `hack/ci-merge-manifest.sh` | Same pattern as step 5 for venv-builder |
| 9 | Supply chain attest venv-builder | `.github/actions/supply-chain-attest` | Same pattern as step 6 for venv-builder |

:::

::: v-pre

Each base image is tagged with both `:latest` (mutable convenience tag) and
`:${{ github.sha }}` (immutable commit-pinned tag). The SHA tag provides an auditable
mapping from any base image in GHCR back to the commit that produced it.

:::

**Outputs:**

| Output | Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python-base-image` | `ghcr.io/<owner>/python-base@sha256:<digest>` | `ghcr.io/c5c3/python-base@sha256:abc123...` |
| `venv-builder-image` | `ghcr.io/<owner>/venv-builder@sha256:<digest>` | `ghcr.io/c5c3/venv-builder@sha256:def456...` |

These outputs are consumed by `verify-base-images` and `build-service-images` via
`needs.merge-base-images.outputs`.

### verify-base-images

Validates that just-assembled base image manifests meet expected properties before
service image builds begin. Runs after `merge-base-images` and blocks
`build-service-images`, forming the dependency chain:
`build-base-images` → `merge-base-images` → `verify-base-images` → `build-service-images`.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `runs-on` | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `timeout-minutes` | `10` |
| `needs` | `[merge-base-images]` |
| Permissions | `contents: read`, `packages: read` |

**Steps:**

| # | Step | Action / Command | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Checkout | `actions/checkout@v7` | Checks out the repository (needed for test scripts) |
| 2 | Setup Docker registry | `.github/actions/setup-docker-registry` | GHCR login (cosign disabled); replaces inline login step |
| 3 | Pull base images | Shell | Pulls both `python-base` and `venv-builder` by digest from `merge-base-images` outputs |
| 4 | Verify python-base | Shell | Runs `verify_python_base.sh` with the digest-tagged image ref |
| 5 | Verify venv-builder | Shell | Runs `verify_venv_builder.sh` with the digest-tagged image ref |

**Test scripts executed:**

| Script | Validates |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/container-images/verify_python_base.sh` | Python version, `openstack` user (UID/GID 42424), PATH includes `/opt/openstack/bin`, virtualenv at `/opt/openstack` |
| `tests/container-images/verify_venv_builder.sh` | uv version (from Dockerfile), pip available, virtualenv at `/var/lib/openstack` |

The job receives image references via `needs.merge-base-images.outputs` (digest-pinned),
ensuring the exact manifests that were just assembled are the ones being tested.

### build-service-images

Builds service images per platform on native runners and pushes each single-arch image by
digest. Depends on `merge-base-images` for image references and on
`verify-base-images` to ensure base images are valid before building on top of them. The multi-arch manifest list is assembled by `merge-service-images`.

On pull requests, ARM64 is excluded (only `linux/amd64` is built) and the image is loaded
locally for inline verification instead of being pushed to GHCR.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `runs-on` | <code v-pre>${{ matrix.runner }}</code> (`ubuntu-latest` for amd64, `ubuntu-24.04-arm` for arm64) |
| `timeout-minutes` | `30` |
| `needs` | `[merge-base-images, verify-base-images, generate-matrix]` |
| Matrix | `service × release × platform × runner` (from `generate-matrix.build-matrix`; ARM64 excluded on PRs) |

**Steps:**

::: v-pre

| # | Step | Action / Command | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Checkout | `actions/checkout@v7` | Checks out this repository |
| 2 | Checkout service source | `.github/actions/checkout-service-source` | Resolves source ref, clones upstream, applies patches and constraint overrides |
| 3 | Resolve extra packages | Shell | Reads `releases/<release>/extra-packages.yaml` via `yq` to extract `pip_extras` (comma-joined), `pip_packages` (space-joined), and `apt_packages` (space-joined). All three fields tolerate empty values — the Dockerfile handles them via conditional guards. |
| 4 | Derive tags | `.github/actions/derive-service-tags` | Composite action. Computes image name and all tags (see [Tag Schema](#tag-schema)) |
| 5 | Prepare platform pair | `.github/actions/platform-pair` | Converts `linux/amd64` → `linux-amd64` for artifact names and cache scopes |
| 6 | Setup Docker registry | `.github/actions/setup-docker-registry` | Buildx + GHCR login (cosign disabled) |
| 7 | Generate metadata for service image | `docker/metadata-action@v6` | Produces OCI labels and overrides version to the upstream release ref via `type=raw` strategy |
| 8 | Build service image | `docker/build-push-action@v7` | Builds with four named build contexts and three build args. Non-PR: `push-by-digest=true`, digest exported as artifact. PR: `load: true`, composite tag |
| 9 | Export service image digest | `.github/actions/export-digest` | Non-PR only. Uploads artifact `digests-service-<service>-<release>-<platform-pair>` |
| 10 | Supply chain scan (PR) | `.github/actions/supply-chain-attest` | PR only: scans locally loaded image via Grype (`scan-mode: image`), uploads SARIF |
| 11 | Verify service image (PR) | Shell (conditional) | PR only: runs `verify_${{ matrix.service }}.sh` with the locally loaded image ref |

### merge-service-images

Downloads per-platform digests from `build-service-images`, assembles multi-arch manifest
lists, then runs SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, attestation, and cosign signing.
Runs only on push events.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `runs-on` | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `timeout-minutes` | `30` |
| `needs` | `[merge-base-images, build-service-images, generate-matrix]` |
| `if` | `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` |
| Matrix | `service × release` (from `generate-matrix.matrix`) |
| Permissions | `contents: read`, `packages: write`, `id-token: write`, `attestations: write`, `security-events: write` |

Tag derivation uses the same `.github/actions/derive-service-tags` composite action as
`build-service-images`, ensuring the manifest is assembled under the exact same tags that
were computed during the build.

**Steps:**

| 1 | Checkout | `actions/checkout@v7` | Checks out the repository |
| 2 | Install yq | `mikefarah/yq@v4` | Required by the derive-service-tags composite action |
| 3 | Normalize image owner | Shell script | Outputs lowercase `owner` value |
| 4 | Setup Docker registry | `.github/actions/setup-docker-registry` | Buildx + GHCR login + cosign |
| 5 | Derive tags | `.github/actions/derive-service-tags` | Composite action. Computes image name and all tags |
| 6 | Download service image digests | `actions/download-artifact@v4` | Downloads all `digests-service-<service>-<release>-*` artifacts |
| 7 | Build service image tags | Shell | Assembles composite + SHA tags (all branches), version + release tags (main only) |

:::

**Build Contexts:**

The service image build passes four named build contexts to resolve `FROM` and
`--mount=type=bind,from=` directives in the Dockerfile:

| Context name | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python-base` | `docker-image://<python-base-image>` | Runtime base image (output already includes `@sha256:<digest>`) |
| `venv-builder` | `docker-image://<venv-builder-image>` | Build stage image (output already includes `@sha256:<digest>`) |
| `<service>` | `src/<service>` | Service source tree (upstream checkout) |
| `upper-constraints` | `releases/<release>/` | Release directory containing `upper-constraints.txt` |

**Build Arguments:**

The service image build passes three build arguments sourced from
`releases/<release>/extra-packages.yaml` by the "Resolve extra packages" step:

| Build arg | Source field | Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PIP_EXTRAS` | `<service>.pip_extras` | Comma-separated | `ldap,oauth1` |
| `PIP_PACKAGES` | `<service>.pip_packages` | Space-separated | *(empty by default)* |
| `EXTRA_APT_PACKAGES` | `<service>.apt_packages` | Space-separated | `libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3 libldap2 libsasl2-2 libxml2` |

`PIP_EXTRAS` and `PIP_PACKAGES` are consumed in the Dockerfile build stage (stage 1).
`EXTRA_APT_PACKAGES` is consumed in the runtime stage (stage 2). See
[Container Images — extra-packages.yaml](container-images.md#extra-packagesyaml) for the
YAML schema.

This job does not declare outputs. The `verify-service-images` job derives its own image
refs independently via its own matrix strategy.

### test-service-images

::: v-pre

Runs upstream unit tests for each service inside the `venv-builder` container.
The job checks out the service source at the version specified in `source-refs.yaml`,
applies any patches and constraint overrides, then executes `stestr run` inside a Docker
container built from the `venv-builder` image. Test results are exported as subunit
artifacts. An optional per-service exclude-list (`releases/<release>/test-excludes/<service>.txt`)
skips known-failing tests via `stestr run --exclude-list`.

:::

This job runs in parallel with `build-service-images`: both depend on
`merge-base-images` and `verify-base-images`, but not on each other. The
`verify-service-images` job gates on both.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `runs-on` | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `timeout-minutes` | `60` |
| `needs` | `[merge-base-images, verify-base-images, generate-matrix]` |
| Permissions | `contents: read`, `packages: read` |
| Matrix | `service × release` (from `generate-matrix.matrix`) |

**Steps:**

::: v-pre

| # | Step | Action / Command | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Checkout | `actions/checkout@v7` | Checks out the repository |
| 2 | Checkout service source | `.github/actions/checkout-service-source` | Resolves source ref, clones upstream, applies patches and constraint overrides; eliminates "MUST stay in sync" duplication with `build-service-images` |
| 3 | Resolve pip extras | Shell | Reads `pip_extras` from `extra-packages.yaml` to construct the install spec (e.g. `.[ldap]` or `.`) |
| 4 | Setup Docker registry | `.github/actions/setup-docker-registry` | GHCR login (cosign disabled); authenticates to pull `venv-builder` image |
| 5 | Run tests | `hack/ci-run-unit-tests.sh` | Runs stestr-based unit tests inside the `venv-builder` container via env var interface; replaces ~50-line inline `docker run` block |
| 6 | Upload test results | `actions/upload-artifact@v7` | Always runs. Uploads `results/testresults.subunit` with 30-day retention |

:::

**Test exclude-list:**

If `releases/<release>/test-excludes/<service>.txt` exists, stestr uses it as
`--exclude-list` to skip tests matching the regex patterns in the file. The file follows
stestr exclude-list format: blank lines are ignored, `#` lines are comments, all other
lines are regex patterns matching test IDs to skip. See
`releases/2025.2/test-excludes/keystone.txt` for an example.

**Test Coverage:**

The `verify_build_images_workflow.sh` script validates test-service-images job structure

| `test_test_service_images_env_vars` | `run:` blocks use `env:` for matrix values, not direct <code v-pre>${{ matrix.* }}</code> interpolation |
| `test_test_service_images_docker_run` | Run tests uses `docker run` with `VENV_BUILDER_IMAGE` |
| `test_test_service_images_feature_comment` | Workflow contains the expected feature comment |
| `test_verify_service_images_depends_on_service_images` | `verify-service-images` `needs` includes both `build-service-images` and `test-service-images` |
| `test_timeout_minutes_on_all_jobs` | All jobs including `test-service-images` have `timeout-minutes` set |
| `test_runs_on_ubuntu_latest` | All jobs including `test-service-images` use `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` |
| `test_matrix_jobs_fail_fast_false` | All matrix jobs including `test-service-images` have `fail-fast: false` |

The `verify_release_config.sh` script validates test-excludes file structure:

| Test | Validates |
| --- | --- |
| `test_test_excludes_file_format` | `test-excludes/keystone.txt` contains valid stestr exclude-list format |
| `test_test_excludes_directory_structure` | All files in `test-excludes/` are `.txt` and named after services in `source-refs.yaml` |
| `test_test_excludes_files_match_services` | Each filename (sans `.txt`) corresponds to a key in `source-refs.yaml` |

### verify-service-images

::: v-pre

Validates that built service images are functional by running `verify_${{ matrix.service }}.sh`. This job replaces the former `smoke-test` job and runs only on push events
(when images are in GHCR). It uses its own matrix strategy matching
`build-service-images` to test every service independently.

:::

On PRs, the equivalent verification runs as an inline step within `build-service-images`
(step 11 above) because `--load` makes the image available only on the same runner.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `runs-on` | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `timeout-minutes` | `10` |
| `needs` | `[merge-service-images, test-service-images, generate-matrix]` |
| `if` | `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` |
| Permissions | `contents: read`, `packages: read` |
| Matrix | `service × release` (from `generate-matrix.matrix`) |

**Steps:**

::: v-pre

| # | Step | Action / Command | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Checkout | `actions/checkout@v7` | Checks out the repository (needed for test scripts, `source-refs.yaml`, and patch counting) |
| 2 | Setup Docker registry | `.github/actions/setup-docker-registry` | GHCR login (cosign disabled); replaces inline login step |
| 3 | Derive tags | `.github/actions/derive-service-tags` | Composite action. Reconstructs tags using the same logic as `build-service-images` and `merge-service-images` |
| 4 | Pull and verify | Shell | `docker pull <image-ref>` then runs `verify_${{ matrix.service }}.sh` with the pulled image ref |

:::

**Test script executed:**

| Script | Validates |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/container-images/verify_<service>.sh` | Service-specific checks (e.g. `keystone-manage --version` exits 0), runs as `openstack` user, no build tools (gcc, python3-dev, uv), runtime apt packages installed |

The job fails the workflow if the verify script exits non-zero. Tag derivation uses the
`.github/actions/derive-service-tags` composite action, which is the single source of
truth shared by `build-service-images`, `merge-service-images`, and `verify-service-images`.

## Tag Schema

Each service image build produces two to four tags on push events:

| Tag | Format | Example | Branches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Composite | `<version>-p<N>-<branch>-<sha>` | `keystone:28.0.0-p0-main-a1b2c3d` | all |
| Version | `<version>` | `keystone:28.0.0` | `main` only |
| Release | `<release>` | `keystone:2025.2` | `main` only |
| SHA | `<sha>` | `keystone:a1b2c3d` | all |

The version-only and release tags are restricted to the `main` branch to prevent silent
overwrites when multiple branches build the same upstream version. The composite tag
already encodes the branch, so `stable/**` builds remain uniquely identifiable.

**Tag components:**

| Component | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<version>` | `releases/<release>/source-refs.yaml` | Upstream OpenStack version tag (e.g., `28.0.0`) |
| `p<N>` | Count of `.patch` files in `patches/<service>/<release>/` | Patch count; defaults to `p0` when the directory is absent |
| `<branch>` | `GITHUB_REF_NAME` with `/` replaced by `-` | Branch name, sanitized for Docker tag compatibility (e.g., `stable/2025.2` becomes `stable-2025.2`) |
| `<sha>` | First 7 characters of `GITHUB_SHA` | Short commit SHA |

The composite tag uniquely identifies the exact build: upstream version, patch level,
branch, and commit. The version and SHA tags provide convenient shortcuts for deployment
systems.

## PR vs Push Behavior

The workflow behaves differently depending on the trigger event:

| Aspect | Pull Request | Push (main / stable/**) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base images | Per-platform digests pushed; multi-arch manifest assembled by `merge-base-images` | Same |
| Base image verification | `verify-base-images` job (always runs) | `verify-base-images` job (always runs) |
| Service image platforms | `linux/amd64` only (ARM64 excluded) | `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` |
| Service image push | No (`load: true` on amd64 runner) | Yes (by digest, tags assigned by `merge-service-images`) |
| Service image tags | Computed but not published | Published to GHCR |
| SBOM generation | Skipped | CycloneDX JSON for every merged manifest |
| Vulnerability scanning | Image-based scan on PR (`image:` input in `build-service-images`) | SBOM-based scan in `merge-service-images` (`sbom:` input) |
| SBOM attestation | Skipped | Sigstore-signed, pushed to GHCR |
| Cosign signing | Skipped | Keyless signature for every merged manifest |
| OIDC token request | None | Requested in merge jobs for Sigstore signing |
| Service image verification | Inline step in `build-service-images` | Separate `verify-service-images` job |
| Verification image source | Locally loaded image (same amd64 runner) | Pulled from GHCR |

**Why base images are always pushed:** Service Dockerfiles reference base images via
`docker-image://` URIs in build contexts. This Docker BuildKit feature requires the
referenced image to exist in a registry: local images are not sufficient. Pushing
small base images on every PR is a deliberate trade-off to keep Dockerfiles
registry-independent.

**Why PRs use single-arch for service images:** `docker/build-push-action` with
`load: true` only supports single-platform builds. Multi-platform images cannot be loaded
into the local Docker daemon. Since the inline verification step needs the image locally,
PRs build only `linux/amd64`. Base images are still built for both platforms on PRs (by
digest), so the native ARM runner is exercised without requiring a locally loaded result.

## GHA Caching

All `docker/build-push-action` steps use GitHub Actions cache for Docker layers:

```yaml
cache-from: type=gha,scope=<scope>
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max,scope=<scope>
```

Each image has a unique cache scope per platform to prevent cross-arch cache collisions:

| Image | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `python-base` | `python-base-linux-amd64` / `python-base-linux-arm64` |
| `venv-builder` | `venv-builder-linux-amd64` / `venv-builder-linux-arm64` |
| Service images | `<service>-<release>-linux-amd64` / `<service>-<release>-linux-arm64` (e.g., `keystone-2025.2-linux-amd64`) |

The `mode=max` setting caches all intermediate layers, not just the final image layer.

## Action Pinning

All actions are pinned to full commit SHAs with version comments, matching the
convention in `ci.yaml`:

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@9c091bb21b7c1c1d1991bb908d89e4e9dddfe3e0  # v7
uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@d7f5e7f509e45cec5c76c4d5afdd7de93d0b3df5  # v4
uses: docker/metadata-action@80c7e94dd9b9319bd5eb7a0e0fe9291e23a2a2e9  # v6
uses: docker/build-push-action@53b7df96c91f9c12dcc8a07bcb9ccacbed38856a  # v7

uses: anchore/scan-action@e1165082ffb1fe366ebaf02d8526e7c4989ea9d2  # v7
uses: actions/attest@a1948c3f048ba23858d222213b7c278aabede763  # v4
uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@8aad20d150bbac5944a9f9d289da16a4b0d87c1e  # v3
uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@faadad0cce49287aee09b3a48701e75088a2c6ad  # v4
```

(GHCR authentication runs `docker login` via the `registry-login` composite action
rather than `docker/login-action`; the pinned SHAs above are kept current by
Renovate, so treat the workflow files as the authoritative source.)

This prevents supply-chain attacks via tag mutation while remaining auditable through
version comments.

## SBOM Generation and Attestation

Every container image pushed to GHCR on non-PR events receives a CycloneDX SBOM and a
Sigstore-signed attestation. This enables consumers to audit image contents,
check for known vulnerabilities, and verify that images have not been tampered with since
build time.

> **Consolidation note.** SBOM generation, attestation, vulnerability scanning,
> build provenance, and cosign signing are handled by a single parameterised
> composite action (`.github/actions/supply-chain-attest`). See
> [supply-chain-attest](#supply-chain-attest) for the composite action interface.

### How It Works

After per-platform images are pushed by digest and the multi-arch manifest list is
assembled by the merge job, the `supply-chain-attest` composite action runs in the
merge job and performs:

1. **SBOM generation** (`anchore/sbom-action`) — Syft scans the merged manifest
   (referenced by digest) and produces a CycloneDX JSON file covering both OS packages
   (dpkg) and Python packages (dist-info).

2. **SBOM attestation** (`actions/attest`) — The CycloneDX file is signed via
   Sigstore keyless OIDC (using the GitHub Actions workflow identity) and pushed to GHCR
   as an OCI referrer artifact alongside the image. No signing keys are managed; the OIDC
   token binds the attestation to the specific workflow run.

This pattern is applied to all four image types via the `supply-chain-attest` composite
action:

::: v-pre

| Image | SBOM output file | Job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python-base` | `sbom-python-base.cyclonedx.json` | `merge-base-images` |
| `venv-builder` | `sbom-venv-builder.cyclonedx.json` | `merge-base-images` |
| `tempest` | `sbom-tempest-${{ matrix.release }}.cyclonedx.json` | `merge-tempest-image` |
| Service (e.g., `keystone`) | `sbom-${{ matrix.service }}.cyclonedx.json` | `merge-service-images` |

:::

### PR Behavior

The `supply-chain-attest` composite action uses its `scan-mode` input to control PR vs
push behavior. On pull requests, merge jobs pass `scan-mode: image` which runs only the
Grype vulnerability scan (no SBOM generation, no attestation, no signing). On push
events, merge jobs use the default `scan-mode: sbom` for the full pipeline.

On pull requests:

- No SBOMs are generated or attested: `scan-mode: image` skips all SBOM/attestation steps.
- No OIDC token requests occur: SBOM/attestation steps are skipped so `id-token: write` is not exercised.
- No attestations are created for ephemeral PR builds.
- PR CI time is not increased by SBOM/attestation steps.

Base images are always pushed to GHCR (even on PRs) because downstream service builds
reference them via `docker-image://` URIs. However, SBOM generation and attestation for
base images are still skipped on PRs: the composite action's `scan-mode` guard applies
uniformly.

### Required Permissions

SBOM attestation requires two additional job-level permissions beyond the existing
`contents: read` and `packages: write`:

| Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `id-token: write` | Allows the GitHub Actions runner to request a short-lived Sigstore OIDC token for keyless signing |
| `attestations: write` | Grants access to the GitHub Attestations API for storing signed attestations |

These permissions are granted to `merge-base-images`, `merge-tempest-image`,
`merge-service-images`, and `build-service-images` (for PR-only scans via
`supply-chain-attest` with `scan-mode: image`). Verification jobs (`verify-base-images`,
`verify-service-images`) do not receive these permissions.

### Verifying Attestations

To verify that an image has a valid Sigstore-signed attestation:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/<owner>/<service>:<tag> --owner <owner>
```

To extract the SBOM predicate from the attestation, first inspect the raw
output to find the exact `predicateType` URI used in your environment:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/<owner>/<service>:<tag> \
  --owner <owner> \
  --format json | jq '.[].verificationResult.statement.predicateType'
```

Then filter for that predicate type (the URI below may differ by action version):

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/<owner>/<service>:<tag> \
  --owner <owner> \
  --format json | jq -r '
    [ .[] | select(.verificationResult.statement.predicateType | test("cyclonedx")) ]
    | if length == 0 then error("no CycloneDX attestation found") else .[0].verificationResult.statement.predicate end
  '
```

### Test Coverage

The `verify_build_images_workflow.sh` script validates SBOM/attestation configuration:

| Test | Validates |
| --- | --- |
| `test_sbom_permissions_on_build_base_images` | `id-token: write` and `attestations: write` on `build-base-images` |
| `test_sbom_permissions_on_build_service_images` | `id-token: write` and `attestations: write` on `build-service-images` |
| `test_verify_jobs_no_sbom_permissions` | Verification jobs do **not** have `id-token` or `attestations` permissions |
| `test_sbom_generation_steps_exist` | SBOM generation steps exist in both build jobs |
| `test_sbom_format_cyclonedx_json` | All SBOM steps specify `format: cyclonedx-json` |
| `test_sbom_generation_references_digest` | SBOM steps reference the correct digest output |
| `test_sbom_attestation_steps_exist` | Attestation steps exist in both build jobs |
| `test_sbom_attestation_push_to_registry` | All attestation steps have `push-to-registry: true` |
| `test_sbom_steps_pr_skip_guard` | All SBOM/attestation steps have `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` guard |

## Cosign Image Signing

Every container image pushed to GHCR on non-PR events is signed with cosign keyless
signing. This provides an independent signature layer alongside the SBOM
attestation, enabling consumers to verify image provenance using standard
Sigstore tooling.

### How It Works

Cosign is installed by the `setup-docker-registry` composite action when
`install-cosign: 'true'` (the default, used by merge jobs). The `supply-chain-attest`
composite action then runs `cosign sign --yes` as the final step of the supply chain
pipeline:

1. **cosign-installer** (`sigstore/cosign-installer@v4`) — Installed by
   `setup-docker-registry` in merge jobs.

2. **cosign sign** — Executed by `supply-chain-attest` in `sbom` mode. Signs the image
   by digest using Sigstore keyless OIDC. The `--yes` flag confirms non-interactive mode.
   No signing keys are managed; the GitHub Actions OIDC token binds the signature to the
   specific workflow run.

This pattern is applied to all four image types via the `supply-chain-attest` composite
action:

| Image | Job | Digest source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python-base` | `merge-base-images` | `steps.merge-python-base.outputs.digest` |
| `venv-builder` | `merge-base-images` | `steps.merge-venv-builder.outputs.digest` |
| `tempest` | `merge-tempest-image` | `steps.merge-tempest.outputs.digest` |
| Service (e.g., `keystone`) | `merge-service-images` | `steps.merge-service.outputs.digest` |

### PR Behavior

The `supply-chain-attest` composite action skips cosign signing in `image` mode. On
pull requests:

- No images are signed: `scan-mode: image` skips all signing steps.
- No OIDC token requests occur for signing.
- The `id-token: write` permission (shared with SBOM attestation) is not exercised.

### Required Permissions

Cosign keyless signing reuses the same `id-token: write` permission required by SBOM
attestation. No additional permissions are needed.

### Verifying Signatures

To verify that an image has a valid cosign signature:

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/.github/workflows/build-images.yaml@refs/.*" \
  ghcr.io/<owner>/<service>@sha256:<digest>
```

### Test Coverage

The `verify_build_images_workflow.sh` script validates cosign signing configuration:

| Test | Validates |
| --- | --- |
| `test_cosign_installer_in_build_base_images` | `sigstore/cosign-installer` step exists in `build-base-images` |
| `test_cosign_installer_in_build_service_images` | `sigstore/cosign-installer` step exists in `build-service-images` |
| `test_cosign_sign_steps_count` | 2 sign steps in `build-base-images`, 1 in `build-service-images` |
| `test_cosign_sign_steps_pr_guard` | All sign steps have `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` guard |
| `test_cosign_sign_steps_reference_digest` | Sign steps reference the correct digest output |
| `test_cosign_sign_uses_yes_flag` | All sign steps use the `--yes` flag |
| `test_cosign_id_token_permission_comment` | `id-token: write` comment references cosign signing |

## Vulnerability Scanning

Every container image is scanned for known CVEs using Grype (via `anchore/scan-action`)
on every push and pull request. Unlike SBOM generation, attestation, and cosign
signing (which are skipped on PRs), vulnerability scanning runs on **both** event types
to provide immediate feedback on high-severity CVEs before merging.

> **Consolidation note.** Vulnerability scanning is part of the
> `supply-chain-attest` composite action. In `sbom` mode (push), Grype scans the SBOM.
> In `image` mode (PR), Grype scans the image directly. Both modes upload SARIF to the
> GitHub Security tab.

### How It Works

The `supply-chain-attest` composite action includes two vulnerability scanning steps:

1. **Grype scan** (`anchore/scan-action`) — Scans the image for known CVEs. On push
   events, Grype consumes the CycloneDX SBOM file (faster, offline-capable). On PR
   events, Grype scans the image directly (since SBOM generation is skipped on PRs).
   The scan uses `severity-cutoff: high` with `fail-build: false`. All CVEs at or above
   high severity are reported in SARIF but do not currently fail the build. Build failure
   on high/critical CVEs will be activated later.

2. **SARIF upload** (`github/codeql-action/upload-sarif`) — Uploads Grype results to the
   GitHub Security tab in SARIF format. Each upload uses a unique `category` value to
   distinguish findings per image. The upload step runs with `if: always()` and a guard
   that checks for non-empty SARIF output, ensuring the upload is skipped cleanly if the
   scan step crashes without producing output.

This pattern is applied to all four image types via the `supply-chain-attest` composite
action:

::: v-pre

| Image | SARIF category | Push job | PR job |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `python-base` | `grype-python-base` | `merge-base-images` | `merge-base-images` |
| `venv-builder` | `grype-venv-builder` | `merge-base-images` | `merge-base-images` |
| `tempest` | `grype-tempest-${{ matrix.release }}` | `merge-tempest-image` | `build-tempest` |
| Service (e.g., `keystone`) | <code v-pre>grype-${{ matrix.service }}</code> | `merge-service-images` | `build-service-images` |

:::

### Scan Input: PR vs Push

The `supply-chain-attest` composite action uses its `scan-mode` input to select the
scan strategy. Internally, the action has two mutually exclusive Grype scan steps (one
for `sbom` mode and one for `image` mode) because `anchore/scan-action` documents
`sbom` and `image` as mutually exclusive inputs:

| `scan-mode` | Grype input | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sbom` (push) | `sbom:` | CycloneDX SBOM file generated in a prior step |
| `image` (PR) | `image:` | Image reference passed via `image-ref-for-scan` input |

The SARIF upload step uses a fallback expression to reference whichever scan step
produced output, since exactly one runs per invocation.

For base images on PRs, the image is referenced by digest from GHCR (base images are
always pushed). For service images on PRs, the image is referenced by the composite tag
from `steps.tags.outputs.composite` (service images use `load: true` on PRs, making them
available locally).

### Severity Threshold

All Grype scan steps use `severity-cutoff: high` with `fail-build: false`:

- **Critical** and **High** severity CVEs are reported in SARIF but do not currently
  fail the build (build failure will be activated later)
- **Medium** and **Low** severity CVEs are reported in SARIF but do not block the build
- All findings are visible in the GitHub Security tab regardless of severity

### CVE Suppression

A `.grype.yaml` configuration file at the repository root allows suppression of
known-accepted CVEs. Grype automatically reads this file from the working
directory (default behavior, no explicit configuration needed).

```yaml
# .grype.yaml — add entries to suppress false positives
ignore:
  - id: CVE-YYYY-NNNNN
    reason: "<justification>"
    fix-state: "not-fixed"
```

The ignore list is initially empty. To add a CVE suppression, append an entry with the
CVE identifier, a justification explaining why the CVE is acceptable, and optionally a
`fix-state` field (`fixed`, `not-fixed`, `wont-fix`, or `unknown`). This prevents
false-positive build failures on unfixable base-image vulnerabilities without disabling
scanning entirely.

### SARIF Integration

Grype scan results are uploaded to the GitHub Security tab via
`github/codeql-action/upload-sarif`:

- Each image has a unique SARIF `category` value (e.g., `grype-python-base`,
  `grype-venv-builder`, `grype-<service>`) for per-image categorization in the Security
  dashboard
- Upload steps use `if: always()` with a guard for non-empty SARIF output, ensuring
  clean skip when a scan step crashes without producing output
- Results appear in the repository's **Security > Code scanning alerts** tab

### Required Permissions

SARIF upload requires `security-events: write` permission on merge jobs
(`merge-base-images`, `merge-tempest-image`, `merge-service-images`) and on
`build-service-images` (for PR-only scans). Verification jobs (`verify-base-images`,
`verify-service-images`) do not receive this permission (least privilege).

### Test Coverage

## OCI Annotations

Every container image receives OCI Image Spec annotations via a two-layer
approach: static `LABEL` instructions in Dockerfiles provide baseline metadata for local
builds, while `docker/metadata-action` in CI generates dynamic labels that supplement the
static ones at push time.

### Static Dockerfile Labels

Each Dockerfile includes a `LABEL` instruction with four OCI annotations that are always
present, regardless of whether the image is built locally or in CI:

| Label | Value (example for keystone) |
| --- | --- |
| `org.opencontainers.image.title` | `keystone` |
| `org.opencontainers.image.description` | `OpenStack keystone service` |
| `org.opencontainers.image.licenses` | `Apache-2.0` |
| `org.opencontainers.image.vendor` | `SAP SE` |

In `python-base` and `venv-builder`, the `LABEL` instruction is placed after the last
`RUN` instruction. In `keystone`, the `LABEL` is placed in Stage 2 (runtime, `FROM
python-base`) before the `USER` instruction: Stage 1 (build) labels are discarded by
Docker's multi-stage build process.

### CI Metadata Action

In CI, each image has a `docker/metadata-action` step that generates OCI-compliant
labels. The action auto-generates dynamic labels from the GitHub context:

| Auto-generated label | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `org.opencontainers.image.created` | Build timestamp (ISO 8601) |
| `org.opencontainers.image.revision` | `GITHUB_SHA` (40-character Git SHA) |
| `org.opencontainers.image.source` | GitHub repository URL |
| `org.opencontainers.image.url` | GitHub repository URL |
| `org.opencontainers.image.version` | Git-derived version (or raw override for keystone) |

The `labels` input of each metadata-action step provides the four custom labels (title,
description, licenses, vendor). These supplement the auto-generated labels.

**Metadata-action steps:**

| Step ID | Job | Image input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `meta-python-base` | `build-base-images` | <code v-pre>ghcr.io/${{ steps.meta.outputs.owner }}/python-base</code> |
| `meta-venv-builder` | `build-base-images` | <code v-pre>ghcr.io/${{ steps.meta.outputs.owner }}/venv-builder</code> |
| `meta-service` | `build-service-images` | <code v-pre>${{ steps.tags.outputs.image }}</code> |

Each metadata-action step's `outputs.labels` is wired into the corresponding
`build-push-action` step via the `labels` input. At push time, CI-generated labels
(created, revision, source, url, version) override any matching static Dockerfile labels,
while the static labels serve as fallback for local builds where no metadata-action runs.

### Keystone Version Override

By default, `docker/metadata-action` derives `org.opencontainers.image.version` from the
Git context (branch name or tag). For keystone, this would produce a Git-derived version
rather than the upstream OpenStack release version (e.g., `28.0.0`).

To ensure the OCI version annotation reflects the actual software version, the
`meta-service` step uses a `type=raw` tag strategy:

```yaml
tags: |
  type=raw,value=${{ steps.source-ref.outputs.ref }}
```

This overrides the version to match the value from `source-refs.yaml` (e.g., `28.0.0`).
The base images (`python-base`, `venv-builder`) do not specify a `tags` input and use the
default Git-derived version strategy, which is appropriate for infrastructure images
without an upstream software version.

> **Note:** The `tags` input on `docker/metadata-action` controls the
> `org.opencontainers.image.version` label, not the image tags passed to
> `docker/build-push-action`. Image tags continue to be computed by the "Derive tags"
> step (see [Tag Schema](#tag-schema)). The metadata-action's tag strategies only
> influence the OCI version annotation.

### Test Coverage

The `verify_build_images_workflow.sh` script validates OCI annotation configuration:

| Test | Validates |
| --- | --- |
| `test_metadata_action_steps_exist_in_build_base_images` | `build-base-images` has `meta-python-base` and `meta-venv-builder` steps using `docker/metadata-action` |
| `test_metadata_action_step_exists_in_build_service_images` | `build-service-images` has `meta-service` step using `docker/metadata-action` |
| `test_service_metadata_uses_raw_version_strategy` | `meta-service` step uses `type=raw` with `steps.source-ref.outputs.ref` |
| `test_base_metadata_steps_have_no_tags_override` | `meta-python-base` and `meta-venv-builder` do not specify a `tags` input |
| `test_python_base_build_push_has_labels_input` | `build-python-base` step wires `steps.meta-python-base.outputs.labels` |
| `test_venv_builder_build_push_has_labels_input` | `build-venv-builder` step wires `steps.meta-venv-builder.outputs.labels` |
| `test_service_build_push_has_labels_input` | `build-service` step wires `steps.meta-service.outputs.labels` |
| `test_metadata_action_labels_include_oci_title` | All 3 metadata-action steps include `org.opencontainers.image.title` |
| `test_metadata_action_labels_include_oci_description` | All 3 metadata-action steps include `org.opencontainers.image.description` |
| `test_metadata_action_labels_include_oci_licenses` | All 3 metadata-action steps include `org.opencontainers.image.licenses=Apache-2.0` |
| `test_metadata_action_labels_include_oci_vendor` | All 3 metadata-action steps include `org.opencontainers.image.vendor` |
| `test_dockerfile_static_labels_python_base` | `images/python-base/Dockerfile` has `LABEL` for title, description, licenses, vendor |
| `test_dockerfile_static_labels_venv_builder` | `images/venv-builder/Dockerfile` has `LABEL` for title, description, licenses, vendor |
| `test_dockerfile_static_labels_keystone` | `images/keystone/Dockerfile` has `LABEL` for title, description, licenses, vendor in Stage 2 |

## Adding a New Service

To add a new service (e.g., `nova`) to the build matrix:

### 1. Create the Dockerfile

Add a Dockerfile at `images/<service>/Dockerfile` following the two-stage pattern in
`images/keystone/Dockerfile`. The Dockerfile must use named build contexts
(`python-base`, `venv-builder`, `<service>`, `upper-constraints`), not hardcoded paths.
Include a `LABEL` instruction in the runtime stage with OCI annotations (title,
description, licenses, vendor); see [OCI Annotations](#oci-annotations).

### 2. Add the source ref

Add the service to `releases/<release>/source-refs.yaml`:

```yaml
keystone: "28.0.0"
nova: "31.0.0"        # ← new entry
```

### 3. Add extra-packages entry

Add the service to `releases/<release>/extra-packages.yaml` with its Python extras,
additional pip packages, and runtime system packages. This file is the source of truth
for build arguments `PIP_EXTRAS`, `PIP_PACKAGES`, and `EXTRA_APT_PACKAGES`: the
service will not build without an entry here.

```yaml
nova:
  pip_extras:
    - oslo_vmware
  pip_packages: []
  apt_packages:
    - libvirt0
```

### 4. Verify matrix discovery

The `generate-matrix` job automatically discovers all services from `source-refs.yaml`
in each `releases/*/` directory. Adding the service to `source-refs.yaml` (step 2) is
sufficient: no manual workflow matrix changes are needed. The job produces
`service × release` matrices consumed by `build-service-images`, `test-service-images`,
`merge-service-images`, and `verify-service-images`.

### 5. (Optional) Add patches

If the service requires patches, create patch files at
`patches/<service>/<release>/*.patch`. The workflow applies them automatically when
present; no workflow changes are needed.

### 6. (Optional) Add constraint overrides

If the service requires constraint overrides, add entries to
`overrides/<release>/constraints.txt`. The `apply-constraint-overrides.sh` script
processes them automatically.

### 7. (Optional) Add test exclusions

If the service has upstream unit tests that cannot pass in CI (environment-dependent,
flaky, or infrastructure-requiring tests), create an exclusion file at
`releases/<release>/test-excludes/<service>.txt`. The file uses stestr exclude-list
format: one regex pattern per line, `#` for comments, blank lines allowed. The
`test-service-images` job picks up the file automatically when present: no workflow
changes are needed.

The tag derivation, build context resolution, source checkout (via
`checkout-service-source`), unit test execution (via `hack/ci-run-unit-tests.sh`), supply
chain attestation (via `supply-chain-attest`), and verification steps all use matrix
variables and work automatically for new services. The `verify-service-images`
job derives its own image refs independently via its own matrix strategy. Note that adding
a new service also requires creating a corresponding `verify_<service>.sh` test script in
`tests/container-images/` and updating the inline PR verification step in
`build-service-images` accordingly.

## Adding a New Release

To add a new release series (e.g., `2026.1`):

### 1. Create release configuration

Create the release directory with required files:

```text
releases/2026.1/
├── extra-packages.yaml       # Extra pip/apt packages per service
├── source-refs.yaml          # Service versions for this release
├── test-refs.yaml            # PyPI version pins for test tooling
├── test-excludes/            # (Optional) Per-service stestr exclude-lists
│   └── <service>.txt
└── upper-constraints.txt     # From openstack/requirements stable/2026.1
```

`extra-packages.yaml` is required: the workflow reads it to resolve `PIP_EXTRAS`,
`PIP_PACKAGES`, and `EXTRA_APT_PACKAGES` build arguments. `test-refs.yaml` is required:
the `build-tempest` job reads it to resolve `TEMPEST_VERSION` and
`KEYSTONE_TEMPEST_PLUGIN_VERSION` build arguments. See
[Container Images — extra-packages.yaml](container-images.md#extra-packagesyaml) for the
YAML schema and `releases/2025.2/extra-packages.yaml` for a working example.

### 2. Verify matrix discovery

The `generate-matrix` job automatically discovers all releases from `releases/*/`
directories. Creating the release directory in step 1 is sufficient: no manual workflow
changes are needed. The job produces `service × release` matrices for all downstream jobs
(`build-service-images`, `merge-service-images`, `test-service-images`,
`verify-service-images`) and `release`-only matrices for Tempest pipeline jobs
(`build-tempest`, `merge-tempest-image`). Verify discovery by checking the
`generate-matrix` job output in a CI run.

### 3. (Optional) Add patches and overrides

Create `patches/<service>/<release>/` and `overrides/<release>/constraints.txt` as needed.

### 4. (Optional) Add test exclusions

If any services have upstream tests that fail in the new release's CI environment, create
`releases/<release>/test-excludes/<service>.txt` with stestr exclude-list patterns. Copy
patterns from the previous release's exclusion file as a starting point and adjust as
needed.

### 5. (Optional) Add Tempest test configuration

If multi-release Tempest testing is needed, create a release-specific Tempest configuration
directory under `tests/tempest/` (e.g., `tests/tempest/keystone-<release>/`) containing
`tempest.conf`, `include-tests.txt`, `exclude-tests.txt`, and `00-keystone-cr.yaml`. Then
add a corresponding matrix entry to the `tempest` job in `ci.yaml` (see
[CI Workflow — tempest](ci-workflow.md#tempest)).

## Verify Container Images Workflow

A separate workflow (`.github/workflows/verify-container-images.yaml`) runs static
verification tests against container infrastructure files without requiring Docker. This workflow validates Dockerfiles, workflow structure, SPDX compliance,
release configuration, and constraint override scripts.

### Trigger Events

The workflow triggers on the same events as `build-images.yaml`:

| Event | Scope | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `push` | `branches: [main, stable/**]` | Runs on every push to `main` or any `stable/**` branch |
| `pull_request` | all branches | Runs on every pull request |

### Permissions and Concurrency

Top-level permissions are `contents: read` (least privilege). The concurrency group
follows the standard pattern: <code v-pre>${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.workflow }}</code> with
`cancel-in-progress` limited to pull request events.

### Job: verify-static-tests

A single job that runs all static test scripts sequentially. If any script exits
non-zero, the job fails.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `runs-on` | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `timeout-minutes` | `10` |

**Steps:**

| # | Step | Action / Command | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Checkout | `actions/checkout@v7` | Checks out the repository |
| 2 | Install yq | Shell | Downloads `yq` binary from GitHub releases (version-pinned via `YQ_VERSION` env var) |
| 3 | Verify build-images workflow structure | Shell | Runs `tests/container-images/verify_build_images_workflow.sh` |
| 4 | Verify deviation comments | Shell | Runs `tests/container-images/verify_deviation_comments.sh` |
| 5 | Verify release config | Shell | Runs `tests/container-images/verify_release_config.sh` |
| 6 | Verify SPDX headers | Shell | Runs `tests/container-images/verify_spdx_headers.sh` |
| 7 | Test apply-constraint-overrides | Shell | Runs `tests/scripts/test_apply_constraint_overrides.sh` |

**Test scripts executed:**

| Script | Validates |
| --- | --- |
| `verify_build_images_workflow.sh` | Workflow structure: job names, dependency chain, trigger events, permissions, action pinning, concurrency, matrix strategy, SBOM/attestation configuration, cosign signing configuration, OCI annotation configuration, vulnerability scanning configuration, test-service-images job structure and steps |
| `verify_deviation_comments.sh` | DEVIATION comments in Dockerfiles cross-reference architecture docs |
| `verify_release_config.sh` | `source-refs.yaml`, `extra-packages.yaml` structure and content validity, test-excludes file format and directory structure |
| `verify_spdx_headers.sh` | SPDX Apache-2.0 license headers present on all infrastructure files |
| `test_apply_constraint_overrides.sh` | `scripts/apply-constraint-overrides.sh` correctly applies constraint overrides |

yq is installed before the test scripts because `verify_build_images_workflow.sh` and
`verify_release_config.sh` use `yq` to parse YAML files. The installation uses a direct
binary download from the mikefarah/yq GitHub releases (more reliable across runner
updates than snap).

### Relationship to build-images.yaml

The verify-container-images workflow is intentionally separate from `build-images.yaml`
because it tests container _infrastructure_ (file structure, conventions, configs) rather
than the container _images_ themselves. Separate workflows provide clear, independent
signals in GitHub's check status UI. The Docker-based image verification tests
(`verify_python_base.sh`, `verify_venv_builder.sh`, `verify_<service>.sh`) run inside
`build-images.yaml` where the images are actually built.

## Verification Coverage Summary

The following table summarizes which test scripts run where:

| Test Script | verify-container-images.yaml | build-images.yaml | Requires Docker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `verify_build_images_workflow.sh` | verify-static-tests | — | No |
| `verify_deviation_comments.sh` | verify-static-tests | — | No |
| `verify_release_config.sh` | verify-static-tests | — | No |
| `verify_spdx_headers.sh` | verify-static-tests | — | No |
| `test_apply_constraint_overrides.sh` | verify-static-tests | — | No |
| `verify_python_base.sh` | — | verify-base-images | Yes |
| `verify_venv_builder.sh` | — | verify-base-images | Yes |
| `verify_<service>.sh` | — | build-service-images (PR) / verify-service-images (push) | Yes |
