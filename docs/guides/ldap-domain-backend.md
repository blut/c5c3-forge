# Attach an LDAP Domain Backend to Keystone

This guide walks through attaching an LDAP/AD-backed identity domain to a
running Keystone with the `KeystoneIdentityBackend` CRD: create the bind
credentials Secret, apply one CR, watch the conditions converge, and verify
an LDAP user can authenticate. The worked example uses the same
`docker-test-openldap` fixture the e2e suite deploys (seeded
`dc=planetexpress,dc=com` tree), so every value is copy-pasteable against a
kind cluster.

For the full field reference, see the
[KeystoneIdentityBackend CRD API Reference](../reference/keystone/identity-backend-crd.md).

## Prerequisites

::: info Devstack
This guide is written against the **[Quick Start](../quick-start.md)** devstack. Stand it up first:

```bash
KIND_HOST_PORT=8443 make deploy-infra
```

Follow that tutorial through to its final **Verify** step, so a Keystone CR named
`keystone` is `Ready` in the `openstack` namespace. Every resource name in the
examples below is one that devstack produces.
:::

- A Keystone CR that reaches `Ready=True`; backends can be applied before the
  Keystone exists, but nothing is provisioned until its API is up.
- An LDAP server reachable from the cluster, plus a bind DN allowed to
  search the user/group trees. On the kind devstack, Step 1 stands up the
  seeded fixture directory; on other clusters, substitute your own directory.
- **Service users stay SQL-backed.** The backend is read-only by default,
  so OpenStack service accounts (and the bootstrap admin) must remain in the
  SQL-backed `Default` domain: the CRD hard-rejects attaching a backend to
  `Default` for this reason. Plan for humans in the LDAP domain and
  services in `Default`.

## Step 1 — Deploy the seeded OpenLDAP fixture (kind devstack)

On the kind devstack, stand up the same OpenLDAP directory the e2e suite uses.
It is a plain namespace-pinned manifest, so `kubectl apply` runs it verbatim:

```bash
kubectl apply -f tests/e2e/keystone/ldap-domain-backend/00-openldap.yaml
kubectl -n openstack rollout status deploy/openldap
```

This ships, all in the `openstack` namespace:

- a seeded `dc=planetexpress,dc=com` tree (users under `ou=people` with
  `objectClass: inetOrgPerson`, `uid`/`mail` attributes, and `userPassword`
  equal to the `uid`);
- a Service `openldap` on port `10389`
  (`ldap://openldap.openstack.svc.cluster.local:10389`);
- a bind-credentials Secret `openldap-bind` holding
  `cn=admin,dc=planetexpress,dc=com` / `GoodNewsEveryone`.

On a non-kind cluster, skip this step and point the CR (Step 3) at your own
directory instead: every value below is one this fixture produces.

## Step 2 — Create the bind credentials Secret

The projection reads two fixed data keys: `username` (the bind DN) and
`password`:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic corp-ldap-bind -n openstack \
  --from-literal=username='cn=admin,dc=planetexpress,dc=com' \
  --from-literal=password='GoodNewsEveryone'
```

Rotating this Secret later re-renders the per-domain config automatically:
the operator watches it.

::: tip On the kind devstack
Step 1's fixture already ships an `openldap-bind` Secret with these exact
credentials (it is the one the e2e suite's own backend CR binds through), so
you can skip this `kubectl create` and set
`bindCredentialsSecretRef.name: openldap-bind` in Step 3 instead.
:::

## Step 3 — Apply the backend CR

```yaml
apiVersion: keystone.openstack.c5c3.io/v1alpha1
kind: KeystoneIdentityBackend
metadata:
  name: corp-ldap
  namespace: openstack
spec:
  keystoneRef:
    name: keystone
  domain:
    name: planetexpress
    mode: Manage           # the operator creates the domain
    deletionPolicy: Retain # keep the domain when this CR is deleted
  type: LDAP
  ldap:
    url: ldap://openldap.openstack.svc.cluster.local:10389
    bindCredentialsSecretRef:
      name: corp-ldap-bind
    suffix: dc=planetexpress,dc=com
    readOnly: true         # the default, spelled out: keystone never writes to LDAP
    users:
      treeDN: ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      objectClass: inetOrgPerson
      idAttribute: uid
      nameAttribute: uid
      mailAttribute: mail
```

Pick `mode: Adopt` instead when the domain already exists in Keystone: Adopt
resolves it by name and never mutates it (adopted domains are also always
retained on deletion).

For `ldaps://` endpoints, add certificate verification:

```yaml
    tls:
      caBundleSecretRef:
        name: corp-ldap-ca   # data key must be "ca.crt"
```

## Step 4 — Watch the conditions converge

```bash
kubectl get keystoneidentitybackends -n openstack
NAME        READY   DOMAIN          KEYSTONE   AGE
corp-ldap   True    planetexpress   keystone   1m
```

`kubectl describe keystoneidentitybackend corp-ldap -n openstack` shows the
progression: `DomainReady=True` (the domain exists in Keystone), then
`ConfigProjected=True` (the rendered `keystone.planetexpress.conf` is mounted
in the Keystone Deployment at `/etc/keystone/domains/`), then `Ready=True`.
The Keystone CR itself reports the aggregate across all attached backends via
its `IdentityBackendsReady` condition; a pending backend holds the Keystone's
`Ready` at False so a half-attached domain never goes unnoticed.

The domains Secret is content-hashed, so the attach rolls the Keystone
Deployment once; subsequent reconciles are no-ops until the spec or the bind
credentials change.

## Step 5 — Verify an LDAP user can authenticate

```bash
# List the LDAP-backed users through the Keystone API (admin credentials):
openstack user list --domain planetexpress

# Issue a token as an LDAP user (docker-test-openldap seeds password == uid):
openstack --os-username professor --os-password professor \
  --os-user-domain-name planetexpress \
  --os-domain-name planetexpress token issue
```

Without the openstack CLI, the same flow works with two `curl`/`urllib`
calls against `POST /v3/auth/tokens`; see step 4 of
`tests/e2e/keystone/ldap-domain-backend/chainsaw-test.yaml` for a
copy-pasteable in-cluster variant.

## Deleting a backend

`kubectl delete keystoneidentitybackend corp-ldap` de-projects the config
first (keystone never runs with config pointing at a dead domain) and then
applies `spec.domain.deletionPolicy`:

| Mode / policy | Effect on the Keystone domain |
| --- | --- |
| `Manage` + `Retain` (default) | Domain stays, including its users' assignments. |
| `Manage` + `Delete` | Domain is disabled, then deleted. |
| `Adopt` (any policy) | Domain always stays — the operator never destroys what it did not create. |

`deletionPolicy` is mutable, so you can decide at teardown time.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| --- | --- |
| `DomainReady=False/WaitingForKeystoneAPI` | The referenced Keystone is not serving yet — check its `KeystoneAPIReady` condition. |
| `DomainReady=False/DomainAlreadyExists` | A same-named domain exists that this CR did not create. The operator never seizes foreign domains; use `mode: Adopt` to attach to it. |
| `DomainReady=False/DomainNotFound` | `mode: Adopt` but no domain with that name exists — Adopt never creates. |
| `IdentityBackendsReady=False/WaitingForBackends` with `IdentityBackendSkipped` Warning events | The bind Secret is missing or lacks the `username`/`password` keys; healthy sibling backends keep working. |
| LDAP users not listed | Check the tree/attribute mapping against your directory (`user_tree_dn`, `user_objectclass`, `user_id_attribute`) — unset fields fall back to keystone's defaults, which may not match your schema. |
| `GET /v3/users` returns HTTP 400 `'enabled' is a required property` | The projected `user_enabled_invert`/`user_enabled_default` fallback was suppressed by a `user_enabled_*` key in `extraOptions` that does not match the directory — with no matching attribute, keystone omits `enabled` from the user model and its own response validation rejects the reply. Align the `user_enabled_*` options with the directory schema (or drop them to restore the fallback). |
| Admission rejects the CR | The message names the exact rule: Default-domain protection, domain-name uniqueness per Keystone, the `extraOptions` denylist, or the fixed Secret data-key contract. |

## Tested by

Attaching the LDAP domain, watching the conditions converge, and authenticating
an LDAP user against the seeded `dc=planetexpress,dc=com` directory are asserted
end-to-end on the CI e2e kind cluster by this chainsaw suite:

```bash
chainsaw test --test-dir tests/e2e/keystone/ldap-domain-backend
```

::: details The backend CR the suite applies
The suite isolates its Keystone instance from the parallel suite pool, so its
backend CR name (`planetexpress-ldap`) and `keystoneRef` (`keystone-ldap`)
deliberately differ from the `corp-ldap` / `keystone` names used in the
walkthrough above.
