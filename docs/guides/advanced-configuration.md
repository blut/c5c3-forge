# Advanced Configuration

Beyond the minimal control plane from the
[Quick Start (ControlPlane)](../quick-start-controlplane.md), the operators
support a number of configuration options for real cluster deployments. This
guide covers the ones the `ControlPlane` CR exposes and points to the reference
for the rest, and to the [Standalone Keystone](#standalone-keystone-without-a-controlplane)
section for the knobs that live only on a Keystone CR you own.

## Prerequisites

::: info Devstack
This guide is written against the **[Quick Start (ControlPlane)](../quick-start-controlplane.md)** devstack. Stand it up first:

```bash
KIND_HOST_PORT=8443 WITH_CONTROLPLANE=true make deploy-infra
```

Follow that tutorial through to its final **Verify** step, so a `ControlPlane`
CR named `controlplane` is `Ready` in the `openstack` namespace and its projected
`controlplane-keystone` Keystone child is running. Every resource name in the
examples below is one that devstack produces.
:::

::: warning The Keystone child is operator-owned
On a ControlPlane deployment the `controlplane-keystone` Keystone CR is
**projected** by the c5c3-operator; the projected fields are re-asserted on every
reconcile, so editing them on the child is reverted. Configure the knobs the
`ControlPlane` CRD exposes on the `ControlPlane` CR. A knob the CRD does not
expose is **standalone-only**: apply it to a Keystone CR you own, in the
[Standalone Keystone](#standalone-keystone-without-a-controlplane) section. See
the [ControlPlane Reconciler](../reference/c5c3/controlplane-reconciler.md) for
the projection contract.
:::

Each pattern below is an independent recipe: apply only what you need.

## Brownfield database and cache

The Quick Start uses "managed mode", where the operator provisions the MariaDB
and Memcached the control plane connects to (`spec.infrastructure.database.clusterRef`
/ `cache.clusterRef`). If you already run MariaDB/Galera and Memcached outside the
operator's reach (managed by another team, hosted externally, or on a different
operator), use **brownfield mode** with explicit connection parameters on the
`ControlPlane` CR.

Brownfield is a **creation-time** decision. The validating webhook freezes
infrastructure presence and the database/cache mode (managed `clusterRef` vs
brownfield `host`/`servers`), the database name, replicas, and storageSize after
the ControlPlane is created, so you cannot flip a managed control plane to
brownfield in place: set `spec.infrastructure` when you first apply the CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: c5c3.io/v1alpha1
kind: ControlPlane
metadata:
  name: controlplane
  namespace: openstack
spec:
  openStackRelease: "2025.2"
  # services.keystone and korc as in the Quick Start (ControlPlane)
  infrastructure:
    database:
      # brownfield: explicit host/port, no clusterRef
      host: mariadb.db.example.com
      port: 3306
      database: keystone
      secretRef:
        name: keystone-db
    cache:
      backend: dogpile.cache.pymemcache
      # brownfield cache: explicit server list, no clusterRef
      servers:
        - "memcached.cache.example.com:11211"
```

The reconciler deep-copies the whole `infrastructure.database` and
`infrastructure.cache` blocks onto the `controlplane-keystone` child, so the
child connects to the servers you declared here.

::: warning In brownfield mode you own schema setup
In brownfield mode (no `clusterRef`) the operator leaves the `secretRef` you
supplied in place (you own that Secret out-of-band) and does **not** create the
database, user, or grants. Provision them before the control plane reconciles:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE keystone DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
CREATE USER 'keystone'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password-from-secretRef>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON keystone.* TO 'keystone'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

The Secret referenced by `secretRef` must contain both a `username` and a
`password` key matching the SQL user: the keystone-operator gates `SecretsReady`
on the child on both, so a Secret with only `password` leaves
`controlplane-keystone` stuck at `SecretsReady=False`. Once those exist,
`db_sync` creates the Keystone schema on first reconcile. The OpenBao
database-tenant onboarding from the [Quick Start (ControlPlane)](../quick-start-controlplane.md)
(Step 4) applies to **managed** mode's engine-issued (Dynamic) credentials only:
a brownfield control plane draws no credentials from the OpenBao database engine.
:::

The webhook enforces that exactly one of `clusterRef` or `host` (`servers` for
cache) is set (never both) for both `database` and `cache`.

[Standalone Keystone](#standalone-keystone-without-a-controlplane) section.

## Standalone Keystone, without a ControlPlane

On the [Quick Start](../quick-start.md) / [Quick Start (Extended)](../quick-start-extended.md)
devstacks a standalone Keystone CR named `keystone` runs with no ControlPlane
projecting it. The recipes below apply to that CR. Several of them
(`spec.autoscaling`, `spec.networkPolicy`, `spec.extraConfig`) are **not exposed
on the `ControlPlane` CRD today**, so a standalone Keystone is the only place they
can be set.

### Brownfield database

The standalone equivalent of the ControlPlane brownfield recipe above: explicit
`host`/`port` and `servers` set directly on the Keystone CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: keystone.openstack.c5c3.io/v1alpha1
kind: Keystone
metadata:
  name: keystone
  namespace: openstack
spec:
  deployment:
    replicas: 1
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/c5c3/keystone
    tag: "2025.2"
  database:
    # brownfield: explicit host/port, no clusterRef
    host: mariadb.db.example.com
    port: 3306
    database: keystone
    secretRef:
      name: keystone-db
  cache:
    backend: dogpile.cache.pymemcache
    # brownfield cache: explicit server list, no clusterRef
    servers:
      - "memcached.cache.example.com:11211"
  fernet:
    rotationSchedule: "0 0 * * 0"
    maxActiveKeys: 3
  bootstrap:
    adminUser: admin
    adminPasswordSecretRef:
      name: keystone-admin
    region: RegionOne
```

The same SQL provisioning and `username`+`password` Secret contract from the
ControlPlane recipe apply. The webhook enforces that exactly one of `clusterRef`
or `host` is set (never both) for both `database` and `cache`.

### Autoscaling (HPA)

`spec.autoscaling` is not exposed on the `ControlPlane` CRD today, so autoscaling
is standalone-only. Replace hand-patching `spec.deployment.replicas` with a
`HorizontalPodAutoscaler` managed by the operator. When `spec.autoscaling` is
present, the HPA owns the Deployment's replica count.

```yaml
spec:
  deployment:
    replicas: 3       # seeds the Deployment; HPA owns the Deployment replica count once created
  autoscaling:
    minReplicas: 2
    maxReplicas: 10
    targetCPUUtilization: 80
    targetMemoryUtilization: 70
```

- At least one of `targetCPUUtilization` or `targetMemoryUtilization` is required.
- `minReplicas` defaults to `spec.deployment.replicas` if unset: omitting it will floor the HPA at your current hand-set replica count, not at 1.
- The generated HPA references `deploy/keystone` and uses the Kubernetes standard
  `metrics-server`. The Quick Start kind cluster does **not** ship one by default:
  the HPA will sit at `unknown/80%` until a resource-metrics API is available.

  On the kind devstack, opt in with the `WITH_METRICS_SERVER` flag. Bring the
  devstack up with it set (the recipe here also needs the ControlPlane, so the
  flags compose):

  ```bash
  KIND_HOST_PORT=8443 WITH_CONTROLPLANE=true WITH_METRICS_SERVER=true make deploy-infra
  ```

  Or, if the devstack is already running, apply the kind overlay additively and
  wait for it to reconcile:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k deploy/kind/metrics-server
  kubectl wait helmrelease/metrics-server -n kube-system --for=condition=Ready --timeout=5m
  kubectl top pods -n openstack   # sanity check: real utilisation, not an error
  ```

  The overlay pins the chart to a single major range and bakes in
  `--kubelet-insecure-tls`, which kind requires because its kubelets serve the
  metrics endpoint with self-signed certificates: no runtime patch needed.

  On non-kind clusters, `metrics-server` is usually already present: most managed
  Kubernetes distributions ship it. If yours does not, install it per the
  [upstream project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) rather
  than copy-pasting an unpinned manifest.

Inspect the HPA:

```bash
kubectl get hpa -n openstack -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=keystone
kubectl describe hpa keystone -n openstack
```

Removing `spec.autoscaling` deletes the HPA and returns replica control to
`spec.deployment.replicas`. See [HPA Resource Mapping in the CRD reference](../reference/keystone/keystone-crd.md#hpa-resource-mapping)
for the exact field-to-resource mapping.

### Network policy

`spec.networkPolicy` is not exposed on the `ControlPlane` CRD today, so it is
standalone-only. When set, it creates a Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` that restricts
ingress to the Keystone API pods. Egress rules for database, cache, and DNS are
derived automatically from the rest of the CR: you only declare the ingress sources.

```yaml
spec:
  networkPolicy:
    ingress:
      # Allow the ingress gateway to reach the Keystone API
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: envoy-gateway-system
      # Allow the monitoring namespace to scrape metrics
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring
```

Each list entry requires a `namespaceSelector` and may narrow it with an optional
`podSelector`. Both are full Kubernetes `metav1.LabelSelector`s, so you can use
`matchLabels` (as above) or set-based `matchExpressions`.
Within one entry the two selectors AND together; multiple entries OR. Ingress is
always restricted to TCP 5000: there is no per-entry port configuration. When the
list is non-empty, all other ingress is blocked by default, **including kubelet
probes from other namespaces**, which is normally not an issue because probes
originate from the node, but verify in your cluster topology.

For brownfield or external targets that the auto-derivation cannot see (an off-cluster
MariaDB host, an external IdP), append explicit rules with `spec.networkPolicy.additionalEgress`:
they are added after the auto-derived ones rather than replacing them.

Removing `spec.networkPolicy` deletes the NetworkPolicy and restores unrestricted
traffic. See the [NetworkPolicy reference](../reference/keystone/keystone-crd.md#networkpolicyspec)
for the auto-derived egress rules (Keystone API → MariaDB, Memcached, DNS).

### ExtraConfig — free-form INI sections

`spec.extraConfig` is not exposed on the `ControlPlane` CRD today, so it is
standalone-only. The typed fields on the CR cover the supported configuration
surface. For everything else (logging levels, oslo.messaging tuning, experimental
Keystone flags), `spec.extraConfig` takes a `map[section][key] = value` that is
rendered into the generated `keystone.conf`.

```yaml
spec:
  extraConfig:
    DEFAULT:
      debug: "true"
      log_dir: "/var/log/keystone"
    token:
      expiration: "43200"        # 12h instead of default 1h
      allow_expired_window: "172800"
    oslo_messaging_rabbit:
      heartbeat_timeout_threshold: "60"
```

The operator does not validate the content of these sections. A typo becomes a silent
no-op at best and a crash loop at worst: test changes in a lab before rolling out.
A change to `extraConfig` triggers a ConfigMap rehash and a rolling Deployment update.
