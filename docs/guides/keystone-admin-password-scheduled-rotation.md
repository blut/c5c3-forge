# Schedule Keystone Admin Password Rotation

This guide walks an operator through enabling *scheduled* rotation of a Keystone
instance's admin password ("Model B"), understanding the resource chain
it stands up, and proving end-to-end that a rotation reached the running Keystone.

This is a companion to
[Rotate the Keystone Admin Password](keystone-admin-password-rotation.md), which
covers the **manual** flow. The difference in one line:

- **Manual.** *You* write the new password into OpenBao by hand; ESO
  projects it into the admin Secret and the operator re-bootstraps.
- **Scheduled / Model B.** A CronJob *mints* a fresh password on a
  schedule, the operator validates it and pushes it to OpenBao, and then the same
  re-bootstrap path applies it. You configure the schedule once and the operator
  does the minting.

Both flows converge on the same final hop: `reconcileBootstrap` re-runs
`keystone-manage bootstrap` against the new credential. This guide therefore
*cross-links* the manual guide's verification steps rather than repeating them.

## On a ControlPlane deployment

Scheduled admin-password rotation (Model B, `spec.passwordRotation`) is
**standalone-only**: the `ControlPlane` CRD does not expose it, and the
`controlplane-keystone` Keystone child is operator-projected. Setting
`spec.passwordRotation` on that child is **unsupported**: the
[guide conventions](../contributing/guide-conventions.md) forbid editing
operator-projected children, and on a ControlPlane the c5c3-operator already owns
the admin credential's lifecycle (it mints and rotates the K-ORC admin
application credential and projects the admin password from OpenBao into
`controlplane-keystone-admin-credentials`). Standing up Model B on the child
would put two owners on the same `bootstrap/openstack/controlplane-keystone/admin`
path.

To rotate the admin password on a ControlPlane deployment today, use the manual
flow, which operates at the OpenBao source without editing the projected child:
[Rotate the Keystone Admin Password](keystone-admin-password-rotation.md).

The rest of this guide targets a **standalone** Keystone CR you own.

> **Names.** The examples target the standalone Quick Start's Keystone: the CR is
> `keystone` in the `openstack` namespace, and its admin password lives in the
> Secret referenced by `spec.bootstrap.adminPasswordSecretRef` — `keystone-admin`,
> under the key `password`; this guide calls it the *admin Secret*. The Model B
> resources are named after the CR (e.g. the CronJob is
> `keystone-admin-password-rotate`) and the per-CR OpenBao path is
> `bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin`. If your Keystone CR has a different name,
> substitute it (and the resource and path names derived from it) throughout.

## Prerequisites

::: info Devstack
This guide is written against the **[Quick Start](../quick-start.md)** devstack. Stand it up first:

```bash
KIND_HOST_PORT=8443 make deploy-infra
```

Follow that tutorial through to its final **Verify** step, so a standalone
Keystone CR named `keystone` is `Ready` in the `openstack` namespace. Every
resource name in the examples below is one that devstack produces.
:::

- A bootstrapped Keystone CR (`BootstrapReady=True`) with the **manual** admin-password
  flow already working: scheduled rotation reuses the same ESO/OpenBao path and final
  re-bootstrap hop. See [Rotate the Keystone Admin Password](keystone-admin-password-rotation.md).
- `bao` CLI access to the OpenBao KV mount (in kind, OpenBao enforces mTLS, so the
  CLI needs a client certificate signed by the OpenBao CA).
- `kubectl` access to the CR's namespace (`openstack`).

---

## 1. Wire OpenBao and the admin ExternalSecret to the per-CR path

Model B writes each rotation to the **per-CR** OpenBao path
`bootstrap/{namespace}/{name}/admin`: for `keystone` in `openstack`, that is
`bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin` (hardcoded from the CR's namespace and name;
there is no knob to change it). Two things must line up with that path before the
first rotation:

**Seed and stamp the per-CR path.** Seed it with the current admin password so
ESO's first sync is deterministic, then stamp it `managed-by=external-secrets` so
the Model B backup PushSecret is allowed to overwrite it. ESO's OpenBao provider
refuses to overwrite a path it does not own and fails the PushSecret with
`secret not managed by external-secrets`; a plain `bao kv put` writes no
custom-metadata, so the marker must be set separately with `bao kv metadata put`:

```bash
# Prompt without echo, then pipe the value in on stdin so the live admin
# password never appears on argv (visible in /proc/<pid>/cmdline for the life of
# the process) or in your shell history file. `password=-` reads the value from
# stdin — this mirrors the in-pod hardening in
# deploy/openbao/bootstrap/write-bootstrap-secrets.sh, which likewise keeps
# cleartext credentials off the command line.
read -rs -p 'current admin password: ' PW; echo
printf '%s' "$PW" | bao kv put kv-v2/bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin password=-
unset PW

# The metadata marker carries no secret, so a plain argument is fine here.
bao kv metadata put \
  -custom-metadata=managed-by=external-secrets \
  kv-v2/bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin
```

**Point the admin ExternalSecret at the per-CR path.** The ExternalSecret feeding
the admin Secret must read the same per-CR path this rotation writes, or the
rotated password never reaches Keystone. On the kind Quick Start the admin Secret
`keystone-admin` is fed by the shim ExternalSecret
`deploy/kind/infrastructure/keystone-admin-externalsecret.yaml`, which reads the
**default-identity** path `bootstrap/openstack/controlplane-keystone/admin`, not
the standalone CR's per-CR path. Repoint it:

```bash
kubectl -n openstack patch externalsecret keystone-admin --type merge -p '
spec:
  data:
    - secretKey: password
      remoteRef:
        key: bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin
        property: password
'
```

> **Own the ExternalSecret for a durable setup.** If your devstack continuously
> reconciles `deploy/kind/infrastructure/` (Flux/GitOps), a manual patch to the
> shim is reverted; own a dedicated ExternalSecret for your CR reading the per-CR
> path instead, as the `admin-password-scheduled-rotation` chainsaw suite
> ships its own CR + ExternalSecret (`tests/e2e/keystone/admin-password-scheduled-rotation/00-keystone-cr.yaml`).
> On a non-kind deployment you already own the ExternalSecret, so just set its
> `remoteRef.key` to `bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin`.

---

## 2. Enable scheduled rotation

Scheduled rotation is opt-in. Add a `spec.passwordRotation` block to the
Keystone CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: keystone.openstack.c5c3.io/v1alpha1
kind: Keystone
metadata:
  name: keystone
  namespace: openstack
spec:
  bootstrap:
    adminUser: admin
    adminPasswordSecretRef:
      name: keystone-admin
  passwordRotation:
    enabled: true
    schedule: "0 0 1 * *"   # monthly, midnight on the 1st (default)
    suspend: false          # default
    passwordLength: 32       # default; minimum 24
```

The four fields of `passwordRotation`:

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Turns the feature on. `false` (or a nil block) tears down every Model B resource. |
| `schedule` | cron string | `"0 0 1 * *"` | When the CronJob mints a new password. |
| `suspend` | bool | `false` | Pauses the CronJob without deleting any resource. |
| `passwordLength` | int | `32` (minimum `24`) | Length of the generated password. |

> **Note.** The defaulting webhook only fills `schedule` and `passwordLength`
> *once `enabled: true`*. A **nil** `passwordRotation` block is
> never materialized: upgrading a CR that never set it must not silently enable
> rotation. The leaf fields above are shown explicitly for clarity; you can omit
> `schedule`, `suspend`, and `passwordLength` and let the webhook default them.

---

## 3. Topology: what the operator stands up

When `enabled: true`, the `reconcilePasswordRotation` sub-reconciler ensures a
chain of resources. A rotation flows left to right:

```
CronJob keystone-admin-password-rotate
  │  (mounts only /scripts/admin_password_rotate.sh; never runs keystone-manage)
  │  PATCH password + forge.c5c3.io/rotation-completed-at
  ▼
staging Secret keystone-admin-password-rotation
  │  operator validates (non-empty, >= min length) and COMMITS
  ▼
push-source Secret keystone-admin-password-next   (operator-owned)
  │  PushSecret keystone-admin-password-backup mirrors it
  ▼
OpenBao  bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin   (per-CR path)
  │  ESO keystone-admin ExternalSecret syncs it
  ▼
admin Secret keystone-admin
  │  secretToKeystoneMapper triggers a reconcile
  ▼
reconcileBootstrap re-runs `keystone-manage bootstrap`  →  credential cut over
```

The resources, by name:

| Resource | Name | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CronJob | `keystone-admin-password-rotate` | Mints a fresh password on `schedule` and PATCHes it onto the staging Secret. Mounts only the rotation script; never runs `keystone-manage`. |
| Staging Secret | `keystone-admin-password-rotation` | Drop box the CronJob writes; the only Secret the CronJob SA may patch. |
| Push-source Secret | `keystone-admin-password-next` | Operator-owned. The operator commits the validated password here; the PushSecret selects it. |
| PushSecret | `keystone-admin-password-backup` | Mirrors the push-source Secret to OpenBao `bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin` (per-CR path). |
| RBAC trio | `keystone-admin-password-rotate` (ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding) | The CronJob's split-RBAC identity. |
| Script ConfigMap | `keystone-admin-password-rotate-script` (content-hash suffixed) | Immutable mount of `admin_password_rotate.sh`. |

Two safety properties are worth calling out:

> **Split RBAC.** The CronJob's Role grants `get` + `patch` on **only** the
> staging Secret `keystone-admin-password-rotation`, and `get` (read-only) on the
> push-source Secret. The CronJob can never write the push-source Secret; *the
> operator* validates the staged value and writes the push-source. Write access to
> the Secret a PushSecret backs is a token-forgery primitive, and it is kept off
> the CronJob's attack surface.

> **Clobber-safe push.** The PushSecret is only created once the push-source
> Secret actually holds a valid password (non-empty, at least the minimum length).
> Before the first rotation completes the push-source Secret is empty, so the
> operator does not push: it would otherwise overwrite the seeded
> `bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin` value with nothing.

> **ESO-managed source path.** The PushSecret can only write
> `bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin` if that OpenBao path carries the custom-metadata
> marker `managed-by=external-secrets` (Step 1). The ESO Vault/OpenBao provider
> refuses to overwrite a path it does not own and fails the PushSecret with `secret
> not managed by external-secrets`.

## 4. Prove a scheduled rotation end-to-end

The monthly default schedule rarely fires when you want to observe it, so trigger
a run on demand and follow the evidence chain. Each step below is something you
can run and confirm.

### 4.1 Confirm the CronJob exists with your schedule

```bash
kubectl -n openstack get cronjob keystone-admin-password-rotate
```

The `SCHEDULE` column should show your `spec.passwordRotation.schedule`
(e.g. `0 0 1 * *`).

### 4.2 Trigger a run on demand

Instantiate a one-shot Job from the CronJob template and wait for it to finish:

```bash
JOB=keystone-admin-password-rotate-manual-$(date +%s)
kubectl -n openstack create job --from=cronjob/keystone-admin-password-rotate "$JOB"

kubectl -n openstack wait --for=condition=complete job/"$JOB" --timeout=120s
```

The timestamp suffix keeps the Job name unique, so re-running this step never
collides with a prior manual Job (`AlreadyExists`) before it is cleaned up.

The Job's pod mints a fresh password and PATCHes it onto the staging Secret
`keystone-admin-password-rotation`.

### 4.3 Observe the operator commit

On the next reconcile the operator validates the staged password, copies it onto
the push-source Secret, deletes staging, and emits a Normal event. Confirm all
three:

```bash
# Push-source Secret now carries a non-empty password and the completion stamp.
kubectl -n openstack get secret keystone-admin-password-next \
  -o jsonpath="{.metadata.annotations['forge\.c5c3\.io/rotation-completed-at']}{\"\n\"}"

# Staging Secret has been deleted (NotFound is the success signal here).
kubectl -n openstack get secret keystone-admin-password-rotation

# The success event.
kubectl -n openstack get events \
  --field-selector reason=AdminPasswordRotated,involvedObject.name=keystone \
  --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

Expected event:

```
LAST SEEN   TYPE     REASON               OBJECT          MESSAGE
5s          Normal   AdminPasswordRotated keystone/keystone   admin password rotation applied from staging secret keystone-admin-password-rotation
```

> **Note.** The password value itself is never logged or echoed in an event. If
> the staged value is rejected you will instead see a Warning with reason
> `AdminPasswordRotationRejected` (empty or too short) or
> `AdminPasswordRotationAnnotationInvalid` (malformed completion timestamp), and
> the staging Secret is retained for inspection.

### 4.4 Confirm the OpenBao value changed and ESO synced it

The PushSecret mirrors the push-source Secret into OpenBao at
`bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin`, and the `keystone-admin` ExternalSecret projects it
back into the admin Secret `keystone-admin`. Use the manual guide's
force-sync + fingerprint technique to confirm the admin Secret carries the new
value: see
[step 2 of the manual guide](keystone-admin-password-rotation.md#2-optional-force-eso-to-sync-the-new-value).

The short version:

```bash
kubectl -n openstack get secret keystone-admin \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d | sha256sum
```

This digest is the same one the operator stamps onto the recreated bootstrap Job
in the next step.

### 4.5 Watch the re-bootstrap (cross-link to the manual guide)

From here the flow is *identical* to a manual rotation: the operator's
`secretToKeystoneMapper` observes the admin Secret change and re-runs the
idempotent bootstrap Job. Follow the manual guide's steps, which are the
authoritative walkthrough.

> **Substitute the names.** The manual guide is written against the ControlPlane
> devstack's `controlplane-keystone`. Reading it for a standalone `keystone` CR,
> substitute `controlplane-keystone` → `keystone`,
> `controlplane-keystone-bootstrap` → `keystone-bootstrap`, and
> `controlplane-keystone-admin-credentials` → `keystone-admin` throughout.

- [Step 3 — Observe the recreated bootstrap Job](keystone-admin-password-rotation.md#3-observe-the-recreated-bootstrap-job)
  (the `keystone-bootstrap` Job is delete+recreated with a fresh UID and the new
  `forge.c5c3.io/admin-password-hash`).
- [Step 4 — Watch the `BootstrapReady` transitions](keystone-admin-password-rotation.md#4-watch-the-bootstrapready-transitions)
  (`False`/`BootstrapInProgress` → `True`/`BootstrapComplete`).
- [Step 5 — Observe the event stream](keystone-admin-password-rotation.md#5-observe-the-event-stream).
- [Step 6 — Recover from `AdminSecretInvalid`](keystone-admin-password-rotation.md#6-recover-from-adminsecretinvalid)
  if the synced value is empty.
- [Step 7 — Post-rotation smoke check](keystone-admin-password-rotation.md#7-post-rotation-smoke-check)
  (the new password authenticates `201`; the old one is rejected `401`).

### 4.6 Note the separation from the live credential

The push-source Secret `keystone-admin-password-next` is a **distinct object** from
the live admin Secret `keystone-admin`. The operator commits the new password onto
the push-source Secret; the running Keystone keeps using the value in
`keystone-admin` until ESO has synced the new value back. A scheduled rotation
never clobbers the credential the running Keystone is using mid-flight.

---

## 5. Per-CR path isolation

Model B scopes the OpenBao RemoteKey **per Keystone CR** to
`bootstrap/{namespace}/{name}/admin`: for `keystone` in `openstack`, that is
`bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin`. Each Model-B-enabled Keystone CR therefore
writes its admin password to its **own** OpenBao object, and the matching
admin-credentials ExternalSecret reads that same per-CR path. Two Model-B-enabled
Keystone CRs in the same cluster no longer share one OpenBao object: they cannot
clobber each other's rotations, so scheduled rotation can be enabled on multiple
Keystone CRs concurrently.

> **Path in lockstep.** The admin-credentials ExternalSecret's `remoteRef.key`
> must match the per-CR path of the Keystone CR whose rotation feeds it; this is
> what Step 1 wired up. For a CR named `{name}` in `{namespace}`, that is
> `bootstrap/{namespace}/{name}/admin`. On a ControlPlane deployment the
> operator-projected `controlplane-keystone-admin-credentials` ExternalSecret
> reads `bootstrap/openstack/controlplane-keystone/admin`, and the bootstrap seed
> (`deploy/openbao/bootstrap/write-bootstrap-secrets.sh`) seeds that path for each
> ControlPlane identity in `KORC_CONTROLPLANES`, but scheduled rotation is not
> configured on the projected child (see
> [On a ControlPlane deployment](#on-a-controlplane-deployment)).

---

## 6. Suspend or disable rotation

There are two ways to stop rotating, with different blast radius.

**Suspend** — keep every resource but stop new runs:

```bash
kubectl -n openstack patch keystone keystone --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"passwordRotation":{"suspend":true}}}'
```

This sets the CronJob's `spec.suspend: true`; the CronJob and all sibling
resources remain. No new password is minted until you set `suspend: false` again.

**Disable** — tear everything down:

```bash
kubectl -n openstack patch keystone keystone --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"passwordRotation":{"enabled":false}}}'
```

Setting `enabled: false` (or removing the `passwordRotation` block entirely)
deletes **all** Model B resources (the CronJob, the staging and push-source
Secrets, the RBAC trio, the PushSecret, and the script ConfigMap) and reports
`PasswordRotationReady=True` with reason `RotationDisabled`.

> **Safety note.** Disabling does **not** remove the last-pushed password from
> OpenBao. The PushSecret uses `DeletionPolicy: None`, so the value already in
> `bootstrap/openstack/keystone/admin` stays put when the PushSecret is deleted. Disabling
> rotation can never lock the admin out of Keystone.

## Tested by

This guide's evidence chain is asserted end-to-end on the CI e2e kind cluster
(CronJob run → push-source commit → OpenBao change → ESO sync → re-bootstrap
`BootstrapReady=True` → new-password `201` / old-password `401`, and the
disable→teardown `RotationDisabled` posture) by this chainsaw suite:

```bash
chainsaw test --test-dir tests/e2e/keystone/admin-password-scheduled-rotation
```

::: details The Keystone CR the suite applies
The suite isolates its Keystone instance from the parallel suite pool, so its
CR name (`keystone-adminpw-sched`) and logical database
(`keystone_adminpw_sched`) differ from the devstack names used in
the walkthrough above.
