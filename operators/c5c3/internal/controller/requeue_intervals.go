	// external.endpointType or spec.region resolving to a different Keystone), not

	// remintStallTimeout / orcTeardownStallTimeout (both 5m) — those wait on work

	// managed mode its MariaDB) is already gone, K-ORC can never complete and the
	// ControlPlane/namespace would otherwise hang indefinitely on Terminating ORC
	// CRs. After this window reconcileDelete strips the openstack.k-orc.cloud/*
